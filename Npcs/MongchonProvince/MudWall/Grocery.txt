[@dungeonescape]
#SAY
A Dungeonescape scroll is a magic paper that moves you promptly
to certain fields near the last village you visited.
The power of Dungeonescape scroll is weak compared with
城镇传送阵 scrolls but it could still save your liefe.

[@randomteleport]
#SAY
A Randomteleport scroll is a magic paper that can
make you randonly move to another place in the same map.
For example if you were in a dungeon 1st floor, you will
move to another place on that floor by using the RT.
If situation is dangerous but you still have potions, use this
to help you out of a tight situation.

[@repairoil]
#SAY
A 修复油 makes the durabillity of you hand weapon rise,
but this oil doesn't special repair your weapon, so
remember that then maximum durabillity of the weapon
goes down as time goes by.
If the weapon at your hand was not expensive,
repair with this oil sometimes during hunting.
This will make hunts last longer.

[@townteleport]
#SAY
城镇传送阵 scrolls carn't be made now because the ancient
skill is lost.... however....
I have heard that it may come randomly from Monsters
and you can return to a village promptly by using it...
